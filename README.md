- 👋 Hi, I’m @ndrouillard
- 👀 I’m interested in vibrational spectroscopy, specifically Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR or FTIR)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a portable FTIR spectrometer, using a RaspberryPi as the control hub to control the components
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything FTIR! This includes numerical simulations, device control, digital signal processing, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: droui116@uwindsor.ca
